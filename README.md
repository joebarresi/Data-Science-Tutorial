# Data-Science-Tutorial
For my CMSC320 Introduction to data science class at UMD, I created a data science tutorial. The tutorial takes you through the entire data science process. It also analyzes the effect of rest on NBA games. This project was done on Jupyter Notebooks and uses lot of popular python libraries including Mathplotlib, htmlrequests, beautifulsoup, pandas, and more.
